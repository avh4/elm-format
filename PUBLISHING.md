# How to publish releases of elm-format


## Workstation setup

### Mac

```bash
brew update
brew install keybase
```


## Preparation

1. Start a new branch from `origin/main` named `release/<new version>`
1. Edit `CHANGELOG.md` to set the correct version number.
1. Create `Release Notes/<new version>.md` to draft the release notes.
1. Update the version number in `elm-format.cabal`.
1. If this is a stable release, update references to the version in `README.md`.
1. Update `ElmFormat.Version.experimental` to `Just <survey URL>` for experimental versions and `Nothing` otherwise.
1. `(cd package/npm && npm version "<new version>")`
1. Commit the changes "Bump version to \<new version>"
1. Create a signed tag for the new version. `git tag -s <new version> -m <new version>`
1. Push the tag. `git push origin <new version>`
1. Wait for CI to successfully build the tag.


## Mac / Windows

1. Pushing the tag should have triggered a build at <https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+release%22>
1. Download the artifacts from the successful build (keep them as zip files)
1. Run `./package/collect_files.sh` passing the paths to the downloaded zip files as arguments
1. Check that the script reports that the new files have valid signatures


## Linux

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
1. Run `./package/linux/build-in-docker.sh`


## Publishing

1. Run `./package/sign_files.sh`
1. Go to the release page for the new tag on github.
1. Enter the contents of `Release Notes/<new version>.md` as the release notes.
1. Upload the zip, tgz and asc files.
1. Publish the release.


## NPM

```
cd package/npm
npm install
# for experimental releases
# npm publish --tag exp
npm publish
npm dist-tag add elm-format@<new version> exp
npm dist-tag add elm-format@<new version> latest-0.18.0
npm dist-tag add elm-format@<new version> latest-0.19.0
npm dist-tag add elm-format@<new version> latest-0.19.1
```


## Nix

```
cd package/nix
./build.sh
```

Then `cd nixpkgs`, push the resulting branch, and make a PR to <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs> with the title "`elm-format: <old version> -> <new version>`"


## Cleanup

1. Create and merge a PR for the `release/<new version>` branch
1. Delete the `release/<new version>` branch
