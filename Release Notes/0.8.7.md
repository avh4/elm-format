## Small improvements and fixed npm installer for Windows

Version 0.8.6 was not widely announced because of an issue with the npm installer on Windows,
so check the [0.8.6 release notes](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/releases/tag/0.8.6) as well.
Below are the additional changes in 0.8.7.

New features:
  - `case ... then` is now auto-corrected to `case ... of`
  - `=>` is now auto-corrected to `->`

Bug fixes:
  - Top-level declarations named "infix" no longer make files unprocessable
  - The npm installer should now work correctly on Windows (was broken for 0.8.6)


## Install

```sh
npm install -g elm-format
```

or [download from the release page](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/releases/tag/0.8.7).
