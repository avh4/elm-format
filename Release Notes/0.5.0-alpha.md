Support for Elm 0.18:
- Added the `--upgrade` option to help migration code from Elm 0.17 to Elm 0.18
  - Infix function calls using backticks become normal functions calls
  - Infix function calls using backticks with `andThen` and `onError` become pipelines
  - Ranges become calls to `List.range`
  - Primes in variable names become underscores
  - References to `fst` and `snd` become `Tuple.first` and `Tuple.second`

Bug fixes:
- Type tags starting with `True` and `False` are now handled correctly
