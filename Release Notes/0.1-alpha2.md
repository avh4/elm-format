> 0.1-alpha2 was [announced on the elm-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-dev/lEzZLg6CvUI)

Hello all!  Prompted by Richard and Evan a couple months ago, I (with help from [Martin](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/commits?author=Janiczek) and [Noah](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/commits?author=eeue56)) have been working on elm-format, a source code formatter for Elm inspired by [gofmt](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code).  There are still a few unhandled cases in the far reaches of the syntax space, but elm-format is now ready for use and feedback.

The goal for elm-format is to make it easy to follow a standard style for Elm code.  The standard style is based on the [Elm Style Guide](http://elm-lang.org/docs/style-guide), which aims to be easy to read,  produce clean diffs, and encourage well-factored code.

You can find the downloads and editor integration instructions here (this is the first time I've packaged binaries for multiple platforms, so if you have any problems running it, please let me know):
- https://github.com/avh4/elm-format
- https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#basic-usage

If you are excited about this kind of tool, please try it out and let me know if anything goes amiss! I have a few more bugs to fix before announcing it more publicly on elm-discuss, and I wanted to give you all a chance to look it over before then.
