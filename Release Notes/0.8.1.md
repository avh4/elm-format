## Autodetecting your Elm version

Starting in `elm-format` 0.8.1, there is now only one official binary for each platform
(previously there was a seperate binary for Elm 0.18 and Elm 0.19).
`elm-format` now will auto-detect your Elm version using the following rules:

  - if `elm-package.json` exists in the current directory, format in Elm 0.18 mode
  - if `elm.json` exists in the current directory, format in Elm 0.19 mode

If you need to run `elm-format` from a working directory that does not contain such a file
(or if you need to use `elm-format` in Elm 0.17 mode),
use the `--elm-version=...` command line argument to disable the autodetection.


## Other changes

`elm-format` 0.8.1 also contains several bug fixes for `elm-format` 0.8.0.
See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/blob/0.8.1/CHANGELOG.md) for details.


## Install

```sh
npm install -g elm-format
