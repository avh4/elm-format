> 0.2.0-alpha was [announced on the elm-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/elm-dev/gR_1ClhZMg0/discussion)

After the tedious work of making the AST retain comments, elm-format-0.2-alpha is ready!  Most notable is the switch to 2-space indentation, as [previously discussed on elm-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/elm-dev/1fWxZPcQVqI/discussion).  There are also now plugins for LightTable, Emacs, and Vim thanks to @rundis, @Bogdanp, and @ajhager!

You can find the downloads and editor integration instructions here:

Here's a brief list of changes:
- changed to 2-space indentation
- comments are handled everywhere they can appear
- fixed a unicode problem with console output on Windows
- parentheses in pattern matches are handled correctly, including a workaround for https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/951
- triple double quotes in multiline strings are handled correctly
- more than one file or directory can be given on the command line
- added the `--stdin` command line option to support IDE plugins
