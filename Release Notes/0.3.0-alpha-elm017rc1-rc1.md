**You only want this if you are trying out the Elm-Platform-0.17 release candidate.  If you are using Elm-0.16, you want [elm-format-0.2.0-alpha](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/releases/tag/0.2.0-alpha) instead.**

> 0.3.0-alpha-elm017rc1-rc1 was a pre-0.3.0-alpha release that works with Elm-0.17-rc1 and was [announced on the elm-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-dev/M5Bk7yVCOHg/tewWr5YYBgAJ)

Regarding the new syntax for the `module` statement, this version of elm-format will automatically migrate 0.16 files to the 0.17 format.

Please report any 0.17-specific elm-format issues here to elm-dev, and not to the github issue tracker.

In addition, expect the next elm-format alpha release shortly after the public Elm 0.17 release.
