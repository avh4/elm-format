Okay, I lied in the [0.6.0-alpha announcement](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/releases/tag/0.6.0-alpha) ðŸ˜„   I decided to add one more big feature before preparing for the public beta.

So I'm excited to announce elm-format-0.6.1-alpha!  The one change is that elm-format now formats your documentation comments, *including any Elm code examples in your documentation*.

Please try it out and let me know if you run into any problems.  I had to make a few choices about what the normalized markdown format should be based on the doc comments of some existing packages, so if you have a lot of familiarity with markdown parsers and have opinions about this, or if you know of other projects that have defined a normalized markdown format, please create a discussion issue on github.

### Install

[Download](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-) or run `npm install -g elm-format`.
