## Binaries for Alpine Linux and Mac ARM64

Feature changes:
  - Detailed error messages for syntax errors have been removed.  Use `elm make` to see a detailed error if elm-format fails.

New features:
  - In `module` and `import` lines, `exposing` is automatically added if missing

Other changes:
  - The npm installer now provides a (Rosetta) binary for Mac ARM64
  - Linux binaries are now statically linked (should now work on alpine linux and other systems without glibc-2.27)
  - Removed `--upgrade` (now use elm-refactor instead)


## Install

```sh
npm install -g elm-format
```

or [download from the release page](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/releases/tag/0.8.5).
