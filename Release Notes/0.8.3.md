## Performance improvements

Thanks to @folkertdev for diagnosing and contributing the fix for a long-standing performance issue
where `elm-format` would take exceptionally long (and sometimes crash) on files contianing large expressions
such as long lists or many other AST nodes with many children.

Other than the performance improvements, there should be no other noticable changes from `elm-format` 0.8.2.


## Install

```sh
npm install -g elm-format
```
